## PROJECTS

### Autoparts E-commerce Application
Data Scientist - Spineor, Mohali

April 2017 - Present

As a Data Scientist, I deal with huge data each day. The major tasks involve analysing the raw data, developing models, processing it accordingly and extracting the meaningful and requisite information out of it. We work with technologies like Apache Spark, Scala, Python, etc. 

## Datastax Graph database representation
Data Scientist - Spineor, Mohali

August 2017 - October 2017

I was involved in modeling the data to form a graph database and traversed it using Gremlin query language.


### [Time Efficient Discovery of Moving Object Groups from Trajectory Data — *Time Series Data* ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VmQewe5SKgn56XOdFrUkQXgnupyRv4Mx/view?usp=sharing)   

We improved the efficiency of travelling Companion framework (a kind of moving object groups). We clustered trajectory data using grid-based clustering having O(nlogn) time complexity which was a huge improvement over traditional DBSCAN which has a time complexity of O(n^2). We used the GEOLIFE Taxi dataset for our experiments. The coding part was done completely in Java. We also published a research paper out of it.

### [Machine Learning Algorithms for Recommender System - a comparative Analysis](http://ijcat.com/archives/volume6/issue2/ijcatr06021005.pdf) 

We implemented several machine learning algorithms like K-means clustering, Naive Bayes, K-nearest neighbour, Content based filtering, Collaborative filtering, etc. All these algorithms were implemented and thoroughly analysed using MovieLens dataset. The major algorithms include Decision Tree, K- mean clustering, Naive Bayes, Content Based Filtering and Collaborative based Filtering. The coding was done in C and Java. We got it published in International Journal of Computer Applications Technology & Research Volume 6, Issue 2, 97-100, 2017, ISSN 2319 − 8656.

### Discernibility matrix Construction & Johnson's Reduct — *A Rough Computing Project*
This project involved the construction of discernibility matrix using Johnson's Reduct method. The project was tested on wine and car dataset available at UCI Machine Learning Repository.
